# Object Oriented Programming: Review Session 1
CodeCore Cohort XI Week 1 review session. Topics to include Classes, Modules, Inheritance, Custom Errors, Markdown, Revisioning.

## Classes: Ball, Ghost, Pacman
Let's take a look at classes and how they interact by modeling out a ball class that may have a type attribute, a ghost class that has a color attribute, and a Pacman class, whose attributes we shall discuss below.  
  
### Ball Class
Create a class `Ball` with a `ball_type` attribute; knowing that `ball_type` will only ever be `regular` or `super`.  
  
Let's start out by creating a ball class that has a getter method for `ball_type`
```ruby
class Ball
  # constructor method
  def initialize
  end

  # getter method
  def ball_type
    'regular'
  end
end
```
